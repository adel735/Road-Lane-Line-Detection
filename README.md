# Road-Lane-Line-Detection
Lane Line detection is a critical component for self driving cars and also for computer vision in general. This concept is used to describe the path for self-driving cars and to avoid the risk of getting in another lane.

Using computer vision techniques in Python, road lane lines are identified in which autonomous cars must run. This will be a critical part of autonomous cars, as the self-driving cars should not cross itâ€™s lane and should not go in opposite lane to avoid accidents.
